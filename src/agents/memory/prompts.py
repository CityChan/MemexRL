_MEMORY_SYSTEM_INTRO = '''
=== CRITICAL: THREE OBJECTIVES ===

You have THREE equally important goals:
1. SOLVE THE TASK correctly
2. KEEP working context UNDER the threshold (shown in [Context Status] after EVERY observation)
3. NEVER make redundant tool calls (same tool + same arguments without file/status changes in between)

SEVERE PENALTIES (can nullify your task success reward):
- Context overflow: If working > threshold, you receive a SEVERE PENALTY that can completely offset solving the task
- Redundant tool calls: Calling the SAME tool with IDENTICAL arguments twice (without modifying files/status in between) results in a SEVERE PENALTY
- These penalties are AS IMPORTANT as solving the task - poor memory management can make a solved task worth ZERO

MANDATORY PRACTICES:
- Monitor [Context Status: working tokens=X, threshold=Z] after EVERY observation
- Compress BEFORE working exceeds threshold (don't wait until it's too late!)
- When compressing, store BROAD coverage in db_blocks - include everything you might need later

CRITICAL - After compression:
- Compressed messages are DELETED from context. The ONLY way to access them is ReadExperience.
- If you need past information, you MUST call ReadExperience(db_index) - re-running tools without file/status changes is forbidden and penalized.

# Base description for CompressExperience (shared across formats)
_COMPRESS_EXPERIENCE_DESC = '''–– BEGIN FUNCTION: CompressExperience ––
Description:
Compress working context to database for later retrieval. Replaces all messages
(except system prompt and task description) with your summary.

Usage:
  • Check [Context Status: working tokens=X, threshold=Z] at the end of each observation
  • Strongly recommended when working > 0.8 * threshold
  • Exceeding threshold will result in penalty
  • After compression, use ReadExperience to get saved content instead of re-running tools
  • When compressing multiple times: include ALL previous indices in your new summary (copy them over), then add new ones

Parameters:
  1. summary (string, required)
     Index map listing ALL stored indices (both old and new). Format:
     - <db_index> - <what it contains>
     - <db_index> - <what it contains>
     Include current status and next steps at the end.

  2. db_blocks (array, required)
     List of content blocks to store. Two options:

     Option A - Write content yourself:
       • db_index (string): Unique key, e.g. "ctx_code_001"
       • db_content (string): Content you write/summarize

     Option B - System auto-extracts from current conversation:
       The system finds text between your anchors and saves it automatically.
       • db_index (string): Unique key
       • start_anchor (string): REQUIRED - exact text where extraction STARTS
       • mid_anchor (string): REQUIRED - exact text that MUST appear in the middle
       • end_anchor (string): REQUIRED - exact text where extraction ENDS
       ALL THREE anchors are REQUIRED. Missing any anchor = failure.

       IMPORTANT for anchors:
       - Choose your own anchors that uniquely identify the content boundaries
       - start_anchor: unique text at the START of what you want to extract
       - mid_anchor: unique text somewhere in the MIDDLE (for verification)
       - end_anchor: unique text at the END of what you want to extract
       - Keep anchors SHORT (20-100 chars), NOT entire code blocks
       - Good: "def _check_required", "raise ValueError", "return result"
       - Bad: copying 10+ lines of code (whitespace errors cause failures)

Tip: Use Option A for summaries. Use Option B only for large verbatim outputs (test results, stack traces) where you want exact copy.

# =============================================================================
# Graph DB Mode Prompts (Typed-edge memory: compress + read + graph query)
# =============================================================================

_GRAPH_SYSTEM_INTRO = '''
=== CRITICAL: THREE OBJECTIVES (graph memory) ===

You have THREE equally important goals:
1. SOLVE THE TASK correctly
2. KEEP working context UNDER the threshold (shown in [Context Status] after EVERY observation)
3. BUILD A USEFUL MEMORY GRAPH so future steps can retrieve evidence by entity, not by recency

SEVERE PENALTIES (can nullify your task success reward):
- Context overflow: working > threshold receives a SEVERE PENALTY
- Redundant tool calls: re-fetching information you already stored = SEVERE PENALTY
- Missing graph structure: storing isolated blocks with no `entity` / `relations` defeats the purpose of graph memory

MANDATORY PRACTICES:
- Monitor [Context Status: working tokens=X, threshold=Z] after EVERY observation
- When you compress, attach an `entity` (the primary subject of the block) and any
  `relations` linking it to other entities. Edges are typed (e.g. "contains",
  "located_in", "answer_of", "evidence_for"). Use whatever edge types fit your task.
- After compression, call QueryGraph(focus=<entity>, hops=N) to retrieve a
  focus-centered subgraph BEFORE re-running tools. Use ReadExperience(db_index)
  for the full content of any single node returned by QueryGraph.

CRITICAL - After compression:
- Compressed messages are DELETED from context. The ONLY way back is QueryGraph or
  ReadExperience. Re-running environment tools without checking the graph first is forbidden.
'''

_GRAPH_COMPRESS_DESC = '''–– BEGIN FUNCTION: CompressExperience ––
Description:
Compress working context into the typed-edge memory graph. Replaces all messages
(except system prompt and task description) with your summary. Each db_block is a
node in the graph; `entity` is its primary identifier; `relations` add typed edges
to other entities (which may be other nodes you store now or in future compressions).

Usage:
  • Strongly recommended when working > 0.8 * threshold
  • Exceeding threshold will result in penalty
  • Always attach `entity` and (where applicable) `relations` so QueryGraph can find this block later
  • When compressing again later: include any previously-known indices in your new summary's index map

Parameters:
  1. summary (string, required)
     Index map listing ALL stored indices and key entities. Format:
     - <db_index> [entity=<name>] - <what it contains>
     End with current status and next steps.

  2. db_blocks (array, required)
     List of nodes to add to the graph. Per block:
       • db_index (string, REQUIRED): Unique key, e.g. "obs_kitchen_001". 1-64 chars, [A-Za-z0-9_-]
       • db_content (string, REQUIRED): Verbatim or summarized content for this node
       • entity (string, OPTIONAL): Primary subject of the node. Strongly recommended -
           without it, QueryGraph cannot find this node by name.
       • entities (list[string], OPTIONAL): Additional entities mentioned in this block.
           Listed entities can be used as `focus` in future QueryGraph calls.
       • relations (list[object], OPTIONAL): Typed edges originating from this block.
           Each relation: {"type": "<edge_type>", "target": "<entity>"}.
           Optional "source": "<entity>" overrides the default source (block's `entity`).
           Choose edge types that suit the task: "contains", "located_in", "answer_of",
           "evidence_for", "subtask_of", "follows", "similar_to", "answers", ...

  Anchor extraction (start_anchor / mid_anchor / end_anchor) is also supported,
  identical to lossless mode; use it for verbatim spans of large outputs.
